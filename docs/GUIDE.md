# Web Engineering 2025-2026 / Lab 1: Git Race

Welcome to the first lab assignment of the 2025--2026 course! This guide will help you complete the assignment efficiently. Although this guide is command-line oriented, you are welcome to use IDEs like **VS Code**, **IntelliJ IDEA**, or **Eclipse**—all of which fully support the tools we'll be using. Ensure you have at least **Java 17** installed on your system before getting started.

## System Requirements

For this assignment, we'll be using the following technologies:

1. **Programming Language**: We're using [Kotlin 2.2.10](https://kotlinlang.org/), a versatile, open-source language that's popular for Android development and server-side applications.
2. **Build System**: The project is built using [Gradle 9.0.0](https://gradle.org/), a powerful tool that automates the building process, including compiling, linking, and packaging your code.
3. **Framework**: The application is based on [Spring Boot 3.5.3](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/), a framework that simplifies the development of production-grade applications. It requires Java 17 and is compatible with Java up to version 21.
4. **Java Version**: The project uses **Java 21 LTS** for optimal performance and modern language features.
5. **Frontend**: The application features a modern responsive UI built with **Bootstrap 5.3.3** and **Thymeleaf** templating.
6. **Containerization**: Full **Docker** support with multi-stage builds for production deployment.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up Git

1. **Install Git**: Download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/) on your system.
2. **GitHub Account**: If you haven’t already, sign up for an education account on [GitHub](https://github.com) using your real name and university email address.
3. **Configure Git**: Set up Git on your local machine with the following commands:

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Real Name"
   git config --global user.email "your_nip@unizar.es"
   ```

4. **Authenticate with GitHub**: Authenticate via HTTPS (recommended) or SSH. You can follow the [GitHub guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git) for detailed instructions.

### Get Access to the Repository

You must use the invitation URL published in Moodle.

### Clone and Run the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use the following commands to clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/lab1-git-race-your-github-username
   cd lab1-git-race-your-github-username
   ```

2. **Test the Repository**: Navigate to the `lab1-git-race-your-github-username` folder in your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew check
   ```

3. **Run the Application**: Start the application with:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

   and open your browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see the application running.

4. **Access the Application**: Once running, you can access:
   - **Web Interface**: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) -- Main application with interactive features
   - **REST API**: [http://localhost:8080/api/hello](http://localhost:8080/api/hello) -- JSON API endpoint
   - **Health Check**: [http://localhost:8080/actuator/health](http://localhost:8080/actuator/health) -- Application health status

### Using Docker

The application includes full Docker support for easy deployment:

1. **Build the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t modern-web-app .
   ```

2. **Run the Container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 modern-web-app
   ```

3. **Using Docker Compose** (Alternative):
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

The Docker setup includes:
- **Multi-stage builds** for optimized image size
- **Java 21 LTS** runtime environment
- **Non-root user** for security

## Development Workflow

### Adding New Features

1. **Implement Changes**: Add your new functionality following the existing patterns

2. **Add Tests**: Write comprehensive tests for your new features

### Code Quality

- Follow Kotlin coding conventions
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Add comprehensive tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Use modern Kotlin features (constructor injection, data classes)

### Git Best Practices (Mandatory for 5% Bonus)

#### Commit Message Guidelines
- **Format**: Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add user authentication", not "Added user authentication")
- **Length**: Keep the first line under 50 characters, add details in the body if needed
- **Content**: Explain what the commit does and why (if not obvious)

**Good Examples**:
```
Add REST API endpoint for greeting history
Fix Bootstrap CSS loading issue in production
Update documentation for new Docker features
```

**Bad Examples**:
```
fix
updates
changes
```

#### Commit History Best Practices
- **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should represent one logical change
- **Frequent Commits**: Commit often with small, focused changes
- **Clean History**: Use `git rebase` to clean up your commit history before pushing
- **Feature Branches**: Create branches for new features: `git checkout -b feature/user-authentication`

#### Branching Strategy
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make commits
git add .
git commit -m "Add initial feature implementation"

# Clean up history if needed
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Push to GitHub
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

#### Avoiding Common Mistakes
- **No Large Commits**: Don't commit everything at once
- **No Merge Commits**: Use rebase instead of merge when possible
- **No Commit Messages Like "fix"**: Always be descriptive
- **No Committing Build Files**: Use `.gitignore` properly

### Complete the Assignment

1. **Review and Document**: Go through the code and add relevant documentation. Make sure your additions are correct and useful.
2. **Create REPORT.md**: Write a comprehensive report following the structure provided above.
3. **Test Your Changes**: After updating the documentation, ensure everything works by running `./gradlew check` again.
4. **Create Zip File**: Create a zip file of your complete project for Moodle submission:
   ```bash
   # Exclude build directories and IDE files
   zip -r lab1-git-race-submission.zip . -x "build/*" ".gradle/*" ".idea/*" "*.iml" ".DS_Store" "node_modules/*"
   ```
5. **Submit to Moodle**: Upload the zip file to Moodle before the deadline. Your instructor will review your submission and inform you whether you've passed or if further work is needed.
6. **Bonus Defense** (Optional): If you believe your work qualifies for the 5% bonus, request an appointment to defend your work in person.

## Tips for Success

### Getting Started
1. **Explore the Codebase**: Take time to understand the existing code structure before making changes
2. **Run Tests First**: Always run `./gradlew test` to ensure the application works before making modifications
3. **Start Small**: Begin with simple enhancements and gradually add more complex features

### Best Practices
1. **Commit Frequently**: Make small, focused commits with descriptive messages
2. **Test Your Changes**: Write tests for new functionality and ensure all tests pass
3. **Document as You Go**: Add documentation while implementing features, not as an afterthought
4. **Follow Kotlin Conventions**: Use modern Kotlin features and Spring Boot best practices

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Breaking Existing Functionality**: Always test that existing features still work after your changes
2. **Incomplete Documentation**: Ensure your documentation is complete and accurate
3. **Poor Git Practices**: This will disqualify you from the 5% bonus
   - Vague commit messages like "fix" or "update"
   - Large commits with multiple unrelated changes
   - Messy commit history with unnecessary merge commits
4. **Ignoring Tests**: Don't skip writing tests for your new features
5. **Incomplete AI Disclosure**: Failing to properly document AI assistance used

### Getting Help
- Use the **Feedback Pull Request** for questions and discussions with your instructor
- Check the Spring Boot and Kotlin documentation for technical questions
- Review the existing test files to understand testing patterns
- Use the interactive HTTP debugging tools in the web interface to test your API endpoints
